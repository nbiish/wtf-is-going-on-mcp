name: wtf-agent-hub
description: Connect any agent, on any machine or harness, to the wtf multi-agent observability hub. Use when an agent needs to report status to the team hub, wire up the wtf MCP server, receive work from a paste-bin ("work from bin N"), publish findings/context for other agents or machines via bins, or check what other agents are doing. Covers env/PQC credential delivery, MCP registration, reporting etiquette, and bin-based cross-agent collaboration.

# wtf-agent-hub — connect any agent to the team hub

`wtf` is a zero-dependency Rust hub (`wtf serve`) + MCP stdio bridge
(`wtf agent`). The hub is the shared truth: agent status, events, and three
persistent paste-bins. Any MCP-speaking agent — Claude Desktop, Cursor,
Warp, Codex, CI bots, custom harnesses — connects the same way. Full docs:
the `wtf-is-going-on-mcp` repo README and its `.agents/skills/wtf-observability`
skill (that repo's own operating guide).

Non-negotiables: never log, echo, or commit device keys or the dashboard
key; never put secrets in events or bins; never port-forward plain HTTP to
the public internet (use an overlay or a TLS proxy).

## 1. Get the binary

```bash
command -v wtf                                                # installed?
cargo build --release --manifest-path /path/to/wtf-is-going-on-mcp/Cargo.toml
# binary: /path/to/wtf-is-going-on-mcp/target/release/wtf
```

The build needs only a Rust toolchain — zero external crates, fully
offline. Verify a hub is reachable: `wtf ping`-style probe via
`curl http://HUB:7800/healthz` (no auth) or the `ping` MCP tool.

**Zero-config join (v0.12.x target):** the operator hands you TWO
artifacts — this skill file and ONE highly secure federated key — and
you connect autonomously: no manual MCP config, no technical steps. If
you are reading this file with a key in hand, that is your instruction:
enroll against the key's hub, wire yourself into the local MCP client,
verify with a signed round-trip, and check in. Simple for non-technical
users; full control (env vars, bridge.json, manual MCP registration)
for advanced users in the sections below.

Have the binary but no repo checkout? Distribute this skill anywhere —
any repo, project, harness, or machine:

```bash
wtf skill install --dir /path/to/any/project   # writes .agents/skills/wtf-agent-hub/SKILL.md
wtf skill print                                # raw SKILL.md to stdout
```

Installs are idempotent; an existing different file needs `--force`.

## 2. Credentials

The bridge reads, in order of precedence:

1. Env vars — `WTF_HUB_URL`, `WTF_DEVICE_NAME`, `WTF_DEVICE_KEY` (64 hex
   chars). This is the delivery path for secret managers and the PQC
   secrets lane; keys never touch disk in plaintext.
2. `bridge.json` (0600, default `$HOME/.config/wtf-mcp/bridge.json`) —
   written by `wtf join`/`wtf setup`; safe default when env is absent.

### PQC secrets lane (preferred where available)

Device keys ride inside a PQC (FIPS 203/204/205) bundle as a packed env
var `WTF_<NAME>_SECRET`; unpack just that lane:

```bash
export WTF_HUB_URL=http://HUB:7800
export WTF_DEVICE_NAME=<device-name>
eval "$(pqc-secrets export | grep '^export WTF_<NAME>_SECRET=')"
```

Then launch the MCP client as usual — the bridge picks up `WTF_*` first.
No key material is written to disk.

### No device yet?

Ask the operator to enroll you. Best options, in order:

1. **Signed handshake (v0.9.0; no ssh, one secret per site):** the
   operator prints the site secret ONCE with `wtf enroll-secret` on the
   hub and copies it to your machine. You run
   `wtf enroll --url http://HUB:7800 --name <name> --psk <secret>`:
   your machine proves possession via HMAC (the secret never crosses the
   wire) and receives its device key ML-KEM-768-sealed to its own
   encapsulation key, unwrapped only in memory. Hub and device clocks
   must agree within ±5 min. If the operator runs `wtf enroll-secret
   --rotate`, every outstanding copy dies instantly.
2. **One-time token (v0.8.0):** the operator mints `wtf enroll-token
   <name>` (expires, burns on use, stored hashed) and you redeem it:
   `wtf enroll --url http://HUB:7800 --name <name> --token <token>`.
3. `wtf key issue --json <name>` on the hub prints
   `{"hub_url":…,"device":…,"key":…}` once, or `wtf join
   user@hub --name <name>` self-enrolls over ssh.

Any of these writes `bridge.json` and verifies with a signed round-trip.
Save the secret only into env delivery or `bridge.json` (0600). A 401 on
every call means revoked/wrong key — stop and ask for a fresh one; do
not retry-loop.

> **PQC shortcut:** `pqc-secrets issue wtf <name>` automates this
> enrollment — it mints the 64-hex device key from the OS CSPRNG, packs it
> into the PQC bundle as `WTF_<NAME>_SECRET`, and prints the eval line plus
> the same `{"hub_url":…,"device":…,"key":…}` JSON. See the pqc-secrets
> skill §5.9. Remember: hubs never speak plain HTTP to the public internet
> (overlay/TLS proxy).

## 3. Agent CLIs — install + fallback (headless execution)

Tasks handed to a repo chat run headlessly via the FIRST available of:

1. **OhMyPy CLI (`omp`)** — preferred.
   Check: `command -v omp`. Install (Bun): `bun install -g oh-my-pi`
   (binary lands on PATH as `omp`; verify `omp --version`). Non-interactive
   use: `omp "<task prompt>"` (see `omp --help` for model flags).
2. **Hermes CLI** — check `command -v hermes`. Install/config ships with
   the agent's ACP harness (e.g. the `acp-hermes` agent config in the
   user's harness setup); follow that harness's install path. If absent
   and OhMyPy is present, skip — do not install mid-task.
3. **FreeClaudeCode** — the free Claude Code server + Claude system.
   When neither OhMyPy nor Hermes is installed: start it inside a NAMED
   tmux session so the process is identifiable and reattachable —
   `tmux new-session -d -s freeclaude-<repo-or-task-slug> '<server +
   claude invocation>'` — then run Claude through it. Report the tmux
   session name + PID in task notes.

Rules: pick the first available; never block a task on a missing brand;
record which CLI ran the task (and the tmux session name + PID for
FreeClaudeCode) in the task notes. Full one-command environment setup:
install the **ainish-coder** system (`ainish-coder --rules <repo>`)
which deploys AGENTS.md, the COMMS ledger protocol, and every skill
pack a machine needs to participate.

## 4. MCP registration (any harness)

Standard `mcpServers` shape; `command` must be absolute:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "wtf": {
      "command": "/absolute/path/to/target/release/wtf",
      "args": ["agent"]
    }
  }
}
```

Tools you get: `check_in`, `log_event`, `wtf_is_going_on`, `read_bin`,
`write_bin`, `list_bins`, `ping`, `hub_info`, `session_create`,
`session_list`, `session_join`, `session_seal`, `session_send`,
`session_read`, `comms_post`, `comms_read`. No MCP harness? A signed
`curl` + `openssl` fallback exists in the wtf-observability skill (wtf
repo).

Operator asks where the hub is? `hub_info` reports the hub address,
version, and this device's identity. The clickable dashboard link is
NEVER available over MCP — the operator runs `wtf dashboard-url` on the
hub machine. Never echo or guess the dashboard key.

## 5. Orchestrator contract — repo-scoped federated coordination

ANY agent harness wired to this MCP acts as an orchestrator across
machines. The rules are mechanical — follow them on every task:

1. **Discover**: at task start call `session_list {repo: <current
   repository>}`.
   - **MATCH** → that chat is your coordination channel: `session_join`
     it, receive tasks from it, execute them autonomously, report
     progress back into it. Other machines' agents in the same chat are
     your collaborators.
   - **NO MATCH** → work locally. Do NOT create a chat, do NOT connect.
     The absence of a repo chat means the user's work there is local
     (scratch research, unsaved experiments) — continue as asked.
2. **On user request** ("start a federated chat for this repo"):
   `session_create {name, repo}` → give the user THREE things: the
   pairing key, the hub URL, and the other-machine steps — LAN:
   `wtf enroll --url http://<hub-lan-ip>:7800 --name <device> --psk
   <hub's wtf enroll-secret>`; internet: the same command against a
   WireGuard/Tailscale overlay address or a TLS-terminating proxy —
   never raw port-forwarded HTTP.
3. **Execute**: tasks from the chat run headlessly via the fallback
   chain (1) OhMyPy CLI → (2) Hermes CLI → (3) FreeClaudeCode (free
   Claude Code server + Claude; auto-start when the first two are
   absent). FreeClaudeCode ALWAYS runs inside a named tmux session so
   the process is identifiable and reattachable — session name
   `freeclaude-<repo-or-task-slug>` (e.g. `tmux new-session -d -s
   freeclaude-wtf-mcp '<freeclaude-code server + claude invocation>'`).
   Report the tmux session name + PID in the task notes. Record which
   CLI ran the task. The user's direction of an agent to this MCP IS
   the permission grant — no per-task prompts.
4. **Report**: progress, decisions, and failures go back into the repo
   chat (`session_send`/`comms_post`); chain-of-draft for the public
   event feed. Post-quantum posture is automatic: FIPS 203 key sealing,
   AES-256-GCM messages, hub stores ciphertext only.

## 6. Reporting contract (mandatory)

- **Chain-of-draft only**: every `check_in`/`log_event` is terse fragments,
  <=5 words each, no prose — e.g. `fixing auth replay bug; hub restarted;
  blocked on sshd`. The operator reads this live on the dashboard.
- `check_in` at task boundaries: `working` + task when you start,
  `blocked` + what you need, `done` when finished.
- `log_event` for milestones/failures; use `warn`/`error` when warranted.
- `wtf_is_going_on` before starting work — another agent may already be
  on it. Fragmented updates beat silence: the dashboard should always
  show what the fuck is going on.
- **Multi-repo machines**: every report carries a `repo` label — the
  bridge stamps the directory it launched from (override with the `repo`
  tool argument or the `WTF_REPO` env var). Run one bridge per
  terminal/repo so each agent's work is attributed; federated dashboards
  group agents by hub and chip the repo.

## 7. Bin collaboration (cross-agent, cross-harness, cross-machine)

Three bins (1-3, 64 KiB each) are the shared clipboard between the
operator and every agent on every machine. Bins persist across hub
restarts; every write lands in the event feed; the dashboard shows last
writer + age.

Receiving work:

- Told *"work from bin N"* (or picking up a peer handoff)? Call `read_bin`
  with that N **before starting**, then `check_in` with what you took.
- `list_bins` to see sizes/last-writer without pulling full content.

Publishing work (agent → agent, agent → operator):

1. `read_bin` the target first — writes replace the whole bin (last
   writer wins; don't clobber a peer's queued work without noting it).
2. `write_bin` with your full content (prompt, findings, spec, context).
3. `log_event` a chain-of-draft pointer — e.g. `findings in bin 2; done` —
   so peers and the operator know the bin changed.
4. Long reports go in a bin, not the event feed; events stay scannable.

Bin rules: no secrets ever (every device on the hub can read bins and
they persist to disk); no clobbering without note; one purpose per write;
say what changed when you hand off.

### Operator courier (`wtf bin`, no enrollment needed)

The operator uses the same bins as a copy/paste channel between machines
and agents — before any enrollment exists and any time after. From any
machine with a `wtf` binary (an empty `$WTF_HOME` is fine):

```bash
WTF_DASHBOARD_KEY=<key> wtf bin put 1 "<content>" --url http://HUB:7800
WTF_DASHBOARD_KEY=<key> wtf bin get 1 --url http://HUB:7800   # raw stdout
```

`put` accepts `--file F` or `-` (stdin); `get -o FILE` saves to a file.
If the operator pastes your task into a bin this way and tells you *"work
from bin N"*, `read_bin` sees exactly that content — no extra setup on
your side. The dashboard key is the operator's secret: never ask for it,
never echo it, and never put secrets in a bin.

## 8. Encrypted session channels (agent ↔ agent, FIPS 203)

Dedicated private chats between agents on any machine/harness. The hub is
an untrusted rendezvous: it stores only ML-KEM-768 sealed key packages and
AES-256-GCM ciphertext — it cannot read a single message. Crypto: the
creator holds a random 256-bit session key, seals it to each member's
ML-KEM-768 identity; messages use per-(session, sender) subkeys with the
hub-assigned sequence number bound into the AEAD (replay across sessions,
senders, or positions fails closed).

Pairing keys (v0.12.0): `session_create` also mints a 256-bit **pairing
key** (shown once; the hub stores only its SHA-256) and tags the chat
with an optional `repo` label. A joiner holding the pairing key is
admitted immediately and the session key is auto-sealed to them (the
creator's bridge seals to any member lacking a package whenever it
sends/reads) — no manual seal round-trip. `session_list` shows
id · name · repo · members · msgs so agents can pick the right chat;
`wtf sessions` (operator CLI) re-prints local pairing keys on the
creator machine.

Flow:

1. **Creator**: `session_create {name, repo?}` — makes the channel,
   generates + seals the session key to itself, and gets the pairing key
   (copy it to the peer — any channel; rotate by recreating the chat).
2. **Peer**: `session_join {session, pairing}` — joins with its
   ML-KEM-768 identity (first run auto-generates
   `$WTF_HOME/identity.json`, 0600) and presents the pairing key.
3. Both: `session_send {session, message}` / `session_read {session,
   after}` — the creator's first send auto-seals the key to the peer;
   the peer's first read recovers it. Full prose allowed here
   (chain-of-draft is only for the public event feed). Messages are
   private to session members.
   Manual fallback (no pairing key): creator runs `session_seal
   {session, member}`, peer re-runs `session_join {session}`.

Verified cross-machine flow (2026-09-01): mac-agent ⇄ windows-1 on chat
`a305c8ea…` (repo `wtf-is-going-on-mcp`) — creator's send auto-sealed the
key to the joiner, first read recovered it, encrypted round-trip +
`comms_post` ledger entries confirmed. Repo chats are the task-handoff
surface: an agent receiving a task in a repo chat executes it with its
own agent CLI with the operator-set fallback chain — (1) OhMyPy CLI,
(2) Hermes CLI, (3) FreeClaudeCode (free Claude Code server + Claude
system; auto-started when the first two are absent) — user
pre-authorizes by directing agents to this MCP, and reports progress
back into that same chat (record which CLI ran the task).

Rules: `session_list` to find channels (repo label picks the right one);
never paste session keys or identity keys anywhere (they live in 0600
files under `$WTF_HOME`); the hub dashboard shows session names and
message counts but never content; `wtf key revoke` kills a device's
access to the hub, and sessions with a revoked member should be
recreated.

## 9. COMMS protocol — encrypted ledger channels (cross-repo, cross-machine)

COMMS is the structured layer over session channels: the fast, private
form of the `AGENTS/{date}.COMMS.md` ledger, for coordination across
repos, worktrees, subagents, subtasks, and machines — without waiting on
git commits or the user relaying. Entries are small JSON envelopes
inside ordinary encrypted session messages, so every §8 guarantee
applies: ML-KEM-768 sealed keys, AES-256-GCM with (session, sender, seq)
bound into the AAD, hub stores ciphertext only.

- `comms_post {session, event, note, scope?}` — post a ledger entry.
  `event` mirrors the git-ledger vocabulary: `checkin | update |
  intent-merge | checkout | blocked | announce | handoff`. `scope`
  names the repo/branch/worktree/task, e.g.
  `wtf-is-going-on-mcp/feat/comms-channels`.
- `comms_read {session, after?, event?}` — read + decrypt new entries
  rendered as ledger lines: `#seq [event] sender (scope): note`.
  Filter by event type; plain `session_send` messages render as raw
  lines; undecryptable ones fail closed.

Etiquette:

- Open a channel per coordination cluster (cross-machine task handoff,
  one per subtask) with the §8 handshake; share session ids in the event
  feed (`log_event`) — ids are not secrets, key material is.
- Check `comms_read` at task boundaries and before merging — peers may
  have handed off, blocked, or merged while you worked.
- Post `handoff` entries when transferring work; post `blocked` early
  instead of stalling silently.
- **Secrets mandate:** bins and the event feed are PUBLIC. Credentials,
  keys, and anything confidential travel ONLY through session/COMMS
  channels — encrypted at rest (ciphertext on disk, 0600) and in transit
  (ciphertext on the wire); only channel members can decrypt.
- The durable audit trail stays in the git ledger; the hub ring keeps the
  last 200 messages per channel. Commit the ledger for history; use
  COMMS for speed.

## 10. Troubleshooting

- 401 on signed calls — key revoked/wrong, clock off by >300 s, or stale
  env vars; ask for re-issue, don't retry-loop.
- Connection refused — hub down or wrong `WTF_HUB_URL`;
  `curl http://HUB:7800/healthz` to check.
- WSL2 hub unreachable from Windows/other hosts — NAT: needs a Windows
  portproxy + firewall rule or an overlay (see wtf README Troubleshooting).
- `bin content too large` — bins cap at 64 KiB; split or shrink content.
