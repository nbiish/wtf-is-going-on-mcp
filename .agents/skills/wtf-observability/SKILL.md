# wtf-observability — Agent & Operator Skill

`wtf` is a zero-dependency Rust pair in this repo: a **hub** (`wtf serve`) that
keeps the shared truth of what every agent is doing, and a **bridge**
(`wtf agent`) that is a normal MCP stdio server. Agents report what they are
working on; a browser dashboard answers *what the fuck is going on* across all
machines. The dashboard houses an embedded **Chat & Agent Orchestration Studio**
paired side-by-side with the **Federated Multi-Machine Shell** (`~/` virtual root).
Dispatched tasks run in attachable `wtf-chat-<slug>` tmux sessions via
the SWE-bench Coding Fleet executor (v0.15.2+). Everything is in-tree (SHA-256, HMAC, JSON, HTTP, MCP) —
no external crates, no network installs, no system packages.

Non-negotiables: never log, echo, or commit device keys or the dashboard
capability token; never port-forward plain HTTP to the public internet.

## 1. Get the binary (no pre-installed tooling required)

Try these in order; stop at the first that works:

```bash
command -v wtf                                    # already installed?
cargo build --release --manifest-path /path/to/wtf-is-going-on-mcp/Cargo.toml
#   binary appears at /path/to/wtf-is-going-on-mcp/target/release/wtf
```

- The build needs only a Rust toolchain and **nothing else**: zero external crates, works completely offline.
- If there is no toolchain on the machine, you cannot run the bridge — but you
  can still *read* the team state through a browser or `curl` using the singular capability dashboard URL (`http://HUB:7800/w/<capability>`).
- Prefer the release binary path in MCP configs; it must be **absolute**.

## 2. Verify connectivity (30 seconds)

```bash
curl -sS http://localhost:7800/healthz
#   {"ok":true,"service":"wtf-hub","version":"0.15.2",...}
/path/to/wtf status            # signed read; needs bridge.json or env creds
```

If `wtf status` prints the agent table, your credentials work end-to-end.
An empty table is success — it means nobody has checked in yet.

## 3. Preferred: report through MCP

Point your harness at the bridge (standard `mcpServers` shape used by Claude
Desktop, Cursor, Warp, and most MCP clients):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "wtf": {
      "command": "/absolute/path/to/target/release/wtf",
      "args": ["agent"]
    }
  }
}
```

The bridge reads credentials from `$WTF_HOME/bridge.json` (written by `wtf
setup`, `wtf enroll`, or `wtf join`) or, overriding the file, from `WTF_HUB_URL`,
`WTF_DEVICE_NAME`, `WTF_DEVICE_KEY`.

Tools you will have (21 in v0.15.2+):

| Tool | Args | When to call |
|------|------|--------------|
| `check_in` | `status` (working/blocked/done/idle), `task` (required), `details?`, `agent?`, `repo?` | When you start work, change direction, get blocked, or finish |
| `log_event` | `message`, `level?` (info/warn/error), `agent?`, `repo?` | Notable milestones, decisions, failures |
| `wtf_is_going_on` | `agent?` | Before you start: see what other agents/machines are doing |
| `read_bin` | `bin` (1-3) | When told “work from bin N”: fetch pasted content before starting |
| `write_bin` | `bin` (1-3), `content` | Publish findings, deliverables, or handoff specs back to peers |
| `list_bins` | — | List bins with sizes/last-writer |
| `hub_info` | — | Probe hub URL, active device name, and hub version without exposing secrets |
| `env_report` | — | Discover local toolchains/versions and publish hardware report to hub |
| `env_probe` | — | Fetch hardware and CLI toolchain reports for all enrolled devices |
| `session_create` | `name`, `repo?` | Initialize an ML-KEM-768 sealed federated lane (mints pairing key) |
| `session_list` | `repo?` | List active encrypted chat lanes filtered by repository |
| `session_join` | `session`, `pairing` | Join an encrypted chat lane using the session's pairing key |
| `session_seal` | `session`, `member` | Explicitly seal session key to a peer device identity |
| `session_send` | `session`, `message` | Post AES-256-GCM encrypted message into a private channel |
| `session_read` | `session`, `after?` | Decrypt and read private messages from an encrypted lane |
| `comms_post` | `session`, `event`, `note`, `scope?` | Append structured envelope (`checkin`, `update`, `intent-merge`, etc.) |
| `comms_read` | `session`, `after?`, `event?` | Read and render decoded COMMS ledger lines |
| `chat_run` | `prompt`, `agent?`, `repo?`, `workdir?`, `machine?` | Dispatch headless coding task to `wtf-chat-<slug>` tmux session |
| `chat_sessions` | — | List active local executor tmux sessions |
| `chat_session_lifecycle` | `session`, `action` | Open, close, reconnect, or delete headless chat execution panes |
| `ping` | — | Connectivity probe (unsigned `/healthz`) |

## 4. No MCP harness? Signed curl fallback

Any agent with `curl` + `openssl` can report. The hub authenticates every
request with HMAC-SHA256 over the canonical string
`wtf-hmac-v1\nMETHOD\npath-and-query\nTS\nNONCE\nsha256hex(body)` (no trailing
newline); the key is the device secret's **raw 32 bytes**, so use `-macopt
hexkey:` (not `-hmac`).

Load credentials (bridge.json is single-line JSON; no jq needed):

```bash
export WTF_HOME="${WTF_HOME:-$HOME/.config/wtf-mcp}"
export WTF_HUB_URL=$(sed -n 's/.*"hub_url":"\([^"]*\)".*/\1/p' "$WTF_HOME/bridge.json")
export WTF_DEVICE_NAME=$(sed -n 's/.*"device_name":"\([^"]*\)".*/\1/p' "$WTF_HOME/bridge.json")
export WTF_DEVICE_KEY=$(sed -n 's/.*"device_key":"\([^"]*\)".*/\1/p' "$WTF_HOME/bridge.json")
```

The one function to rule them all:

```bash
wtf_call() {  # wtf_call METHOD PATH [JSON_BODY]
  local method="$1" path="$2" body="${3:-}"
  local ts nonce bh sig
  ts=$(date +%s)
  nonce=$(head -c16 /dev/urandom | od -An -tx1 | tr -d ' \n')
  bh=$(printf '%s' "$body" | openssl dgst -sha256 -hex | awk '{print $NF}')
  sig=$(printf 'wtf-hmac-v1\n%s\n%s\n%s\n%s\n%s' "$method" "$path" "$ts" "$nonce" "$bh" \
        | openssl dgst -sha256 -mac hmac -macopt "hexkey:$WTF_DEVICE_KEY" -hex \
        | awk '{print $NF}')
  if [ -n "$body" ]; then
    curl -sS -X "$method" "$WTF_HUB_URL$path" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -H "X-Wtf-Device: $WTF_DEVICE_NAME" -H "X-Wtf-Timestamp: $ts" \
      -H "X-Wtf-Nonce: $nonce" -H "X-Wtf-Signature: $sig" --data "$body"
  else
    curl -sS -X "$method" "$WTF_HUB_URL$path" \
      -H "X-Wtf-Device: $WTF_DEVICE_NAME" -H "X-Wtf-Timestamp: $ts" \
      -H "X-Wtf-Nonce: $nonce" -H "X-Wtf-Signature: $sig"
  fi
}
```

Usage — exactly one call each, expect `{"ok":true,"id":N}`:

```bash
wtf_call POST /api/v1/checkin '{"status":"working","task":"refactor parser","details":"phase 2"}'
wtf_call POST /api/v1/event   '{"message":"tests green","level":"info"}'
wtf_call POST /api/v1/heartbeat
wtf_call GET  /api/v1/state | head -c 400   # full team state JSON
wtf_call GET  /api/v1/bins/1                # operator paste-bin N (1-3)
wtf_call GET  /api/v1/bins                  # all three bins
wtf_call GET  /api/v1/shell/machines        # discover federated shell cluster machines
```

## 5. Singular Dashboard URL & Federated Multi-Machine Shell

1. **Singular Capability Dashboard URL**:
   The hub mints an unguessable 64-hex capability token in `$WTF_HOME/dashboard_capability` (0600).
   Run `wtf dashboard-url` to output the singular capability link:
   ```bash
   wtf dashboard-url
   # Output: dashboard: http://<host>:7800/w/<64-hex-capability>
   ```
   Opens uniformly across loopback, LAN, and reverse proxies without secret leakage in query strings.
   Any unauthenticated access returns a uniform `404 Not Found` (legacy `?k=` retired under R5).

2. **Embedded Chat & Agent Orchestration Studio**:
   - Integrated into the left pane of `/w/<capability>`.
   - Dispatches SWE-bench coding fleet tasks across the 11-agent CLI catalog (`auto`, `fleet`, `claude`, `omp`, `hermes`, `trae-cli`, `mini`, `codex`, `opencode`, `aider`, `cline`, `pi`).
   - All engines route through `local-router/fallback-models` on `127.0.0.1:11434`.

3. **Paired Federated Multi-Machine Shell & Intelligent Distributed Compute**:
   - Integrated into the right pane of `/w/<capability>`.
   - Virtual root (`~/`) maps to connected cluster machines (`~/mac`, `~/windows`, `~/creeper-pi`).
   - Persistent per-architecture LKGL (`$WTF_HOME/lkgl.json`) automatically anchors commands and dispatched tasks to native workspace directories.
   - Synchronized federated OMP config (`$WTF_HOME/fed_omp_config.json`) coordinates model parameters and fallback cascades.
   - Intelligent Distributed Compute: Agents on edge devices (like Raspberry Pi) dispatch tasks to cluster heavies via `chat_run(machine="<target>")` or shell API.
   - Run multi-machine compound commands in a single prompt:
     ```bash
     cd ~/mac/frontend && npm test && cd ~/windows/backend && cargo test
     ```
   - Shows colored machine badge output (`[mac]`, `[windows]`) in the terminal log.

## 6. Operator Reference (hub side)

```bash
wtf serve [--bind IP:PORT] [--no-open]     # run hub; prints singular capability link
wtf dashboard-url                          # print the singular capability URL (/w/<cap>)
wtf url [URL | clear]                      # set advertised URL (e.g. proxy or overlay)
wtf enroll-token <name> [--ttl SECS]       # mint one-time enrollment token (burns on use)
wtf enroll-secret                          # display site PSK for signed enrollment
wtf enroll-secret --rotate                 # rotate site PSK, revoking outstanding copies
wtf key issue [--json] <name>              # provision device; key printed ONCE
wtf key list                               # devices + revoked state
wtf key revoke <name>                      # instant kill switch, no restart
wtf setup --url URL --name N --key K       # manual local enrollment
wtf join user@hub-host [--name N] [--url U]# self-enroll over ssh
wtf federate add <name> --url U --psk S    # join a peer hub to the federation mesh
```

State lives in `$WTF_HOME` (default `~/.config/wtf-mcp`): `config.json`,
`dashboard_capability` (0600), `keys.json`, `bridge.json`, `identities.json` (0600,
persisted ML-KEM-768 identities), `enroll_tokens.json` (0600, hashed tokens),
`events.jsonl` (append-only source of truth).

## 7. Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Cause -> fix |
|---------|-------------|
| HTTP 401 on signed call | key revoked/wrong, clock off by >300 s, or signature input mismatch. |
| HTTP 404 on `/` or `/w/...` | capability token missing or wrong; run `wtf dashboard-url` on the hub machine. |
| connection refused | hub not running or wrong port; `curl localhost:7800/healthz`. |
| "cannot bind" on serve | port taken; `--bind localhost:PORT` or another port. |
| join exit 127 | `wtf` not in the hub host's PATH — install/symlink it there. |
| WSL2 hub unreachable from Windows | NAT: needs Windows `netsh interface portproxy` rule on 7800 + firewall allow. |
| `bin content too large` | bins cap at 64 KiB; split or shrink content. |

## 8. Self-check before declaring victory

```bash
curl -sS "$WTF_HUB_URL/healthz"                                   # ok:true
wtf status                                                        # your agent listed
wtf_call POST /api/v1/checkin '{"status":"working","task":"self-check"}'   # ok:true
```
